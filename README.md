## YahooReader
---
The YahooReader class is able to fetch datasets provided by [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). Because Yahoo Finance
has no company logo and isin data, the YahooReader class instead compiles its logo data from [Clearbit](https://clearbit.com/logo)
and its isin from [Businessinsider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/).
